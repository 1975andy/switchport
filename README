# This directory contains
#
# switchport.py		python file which reads a "network plan" (in json format) to produce
#					command files to configure Ethernet Switchports properly to carry
#					the Replicast(TM) protocol used by the NexentaEdge product for
#					internal storge traffic.
#
#					This is designed to be incremental configuration done after
#					base configuration of the swsitches is complete. The base
#					configuration should deal with issues such as creation of trunking,
#					setting up administrative interfaces and IP addresses,
#					configuration of non-Replicast ports and creation of any 
#					non-replicast VLANs required.
#					
#					Usage is covered later in this README document.
#	aristra_eos.py	python file that generates commands for Arista EOS switches
#	cisco_nxos.py	python file that generates commands for Cisco NXOS switche
#	inventec_icos.py	python file that generates commands for Inventec ICOS switches
#	unknonw_switch.py	python file that services as a catchall class when a switch
#						defined in the network plan is not known.
#	netplan-example.json	Example network plan json file
#	netplan-access-example.json	Another example network plan with access mode switchports.
#	out						Sub-directory where output is generated
#
# Other switches can be added. Just be sure to add them to the factory function in
# switchport.py that imports the full set and invokes the correct constructor when
# parsing the network plan json file.
#
# And yes, this should be changed to dynamically load any named script file.
# Since you asked, when can we expect your patch?
#
# Usage
#		switchport.py <name-of-network-plan-json-file>
#
# This will generate the following output files:
#
#		out/lldp	An enumeration (one per line) of possible replicast enabled
#					switchports which hosts can recognize using lldp.
#
#						TBD: instructions on how this should be distributed.
#						TBD: specify syntax for benefit of do-it-yourselfers
#		out/<switch-name>.cmd	Text file of commands for <switch-name> to configure
#								this switch. This command must be submitted to the
#								switch with appropriate credentials.
#		out/<switch-protocol-name>.<profile>.cmd
#						Text file for commands that could be applied, with appropriate
#						credentials, to configure a Switch using <switch-protocol-name>
#						to apply the specified switchport profile.
#
#						Using these commands requires a user-generated wrapper to
#						specify the port to be dynamically configured and supplying
#						credentials if required.
#
#						Most switch CLI syntax was inspired Cisco, so for most this
#						will require pre-panding lines like "interface ethernet <x>"
#						where <x> is the switchport or a switchpoir list.
#
# The network-plan json file must define a single json object with the following structure
#
#		"single-vlan-mode" -- either "access" or "trunk". If 'access' the 'profiles'
#						   -- section should define only profiles with a single vlan
#		"switches"	-- an array of switch names, each with
#			"protocol"	-- the protocol this switch supports, must be in the protocols list
#			"macaddr"	-- The Mac Address that will identify this switch using lldp

#		"protocols" -- an array of support switch protocols
#			"lldp-map" 	-- List of two element arrays that provide the rules for
#						-- mapping a switchport interface name to recognizable text
#					 	-- that can be obtained using lldp
#		"profiles"	-- an array of one or more named profiles for switchports.
#					-- <profile_name>:{<list of vlan names>}
#		"vlans" -- an array of <vlan-name>:{<vlan-parms>}. The <vlan-parms> are:
#			"no-drop": "true" or "false
#				Is this the VLAN that carries the replicast traffic? On any switchport
#				that carries Replicast traffic this must be the only PFC protected
#				VLAN.
#			"vlan": <id>
#				The numeric vlan id.
#			"cos":<cos>
#				The Ethernet Class of Service (0..7) for this VLAN. The cos assigned
#				for the Replicast vlan should be exclusive to it on all the switchports
#				describe in the network plan.
#			"weight":<weight>
#				The weight this vlan should recieve in the weighted round-robing
#				distribution across the vlans in a profile
#
